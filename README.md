# Phishing-email-analysis
The objective of this task is to identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.


## Phishing Email Analysis

*In this section, I have analyzed the provided sample phishing email and identified the following malicious characteristics.*

### Phishing Indicators Found

* [cite_start]**Suspicious Sender's Email Address:** The sender's address is `domain@domain-name.com`[cite: 1]. This is a generic, non-official address and not a legitimate government domain (like .gov), which immediately makes it suspicious.
* [cite_start]**Impersonation of Authority:** The email claims to be from the "National Security Department" and uses an official-looking logo to appear credible and impersonate a government agency[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Urgent and Alarming Language:** The email creates a sense of fear by claiming a vulnerability allows an attacker to "record calls and videos from your mobile device without your knowledge"[cite: 1]. [cite_start]It then creates urgency by stating, "This website will be available for 72 hours"[cite: 1]. This pressure is designed to make the victim act without thinking.
* [cite_start]**Suspicious Call to Action:** The primary goal is to get the user to click the "Facetime Verification" button[cite: 1]. In a real-world scenario, hovering over this link would likely reveal a malicious URL that is not related to Apple or any government entity.
* [cite_start]**Generic Salutation:** The email is addressed to "Your email" instead of the recipient's actual name[cite: 1]. Legitimate and important security alerts from a service you use are typically personalized.
